"I must admit , when I sat down to watch this , I was pleasantly surprised ; it was funnier than I had imagined . . . however , with my expectations being very , very low , it doesn't really mean that the film is anything more than average . A pretty good amount of laughs , but nothing memorable . The ending seemed to be too much of a "" happy ending "" and was obviously done to open the film up to the mainstream crowd . The plot is decent enough , but it is obviously just written to put the characters in unlikely situations , and is at least a little too over-the-top . The pacing is pretty good , the film isn't really boring","I caught this on a plane , as one of the in-flight movies . This was basically the one that made me feel the least amount of strong repulsion , of all the available choices , so I endured the 90 minutes , with some pretty scattered enjoyment . There are some funny things . . . the scene in the dojo isn't all bad . Mostly , the humor didn't really work , at least for me , though . Tucker seems to be growing more irritating as time goes on , and his character seems to have gotten somewhat incompetent . . . in the first film ( I haven't seen the second ) , he was a good cop , unorthodox , and not necessarily popular , but he didn't come off as inept as he did in this . I'm not sure anyone should have to be subjected to the "" singing "" of either",1

". . . another of their loose adaptations of classic horror novels , in which Baron Victor Frankenstein ( the inimitable Peter Cushing ) becomes obsessed with his scientific experiments , and creates large , lumbering being ( Christopher Lee ) that causes chaos and terror . Lee is buried under what must have been pretty elaborate makeup for its time , and you may not recognize him . As befitting a portrayal of the Frankenstein monster , he garners some sympathy for the poor , addled creature . Cushing is also memorable as the hopelessly dedicated Victor , and I enjoyed the work of Robert Urquhart as Paul Krempe , the tutor who at first willingly helps Victor in his pursuits but turns against him when he realizes that nothing good can come of their actions . Not really good enough for me to count as a classic film ; I think that","A race of evil aliens ( they're actually giant cockroaches who inhibit the bodies of recently deceased folks ) call upon the ferocious three-headed dragon King Ghidorah and sharp-beaked bird beast Gigan ( he's got a huge buzzsaw in his belly ! ) to destroy us puny helpless humans so they can take over the planet . Luckily , the almighty Godzilla and his spike-backed gigantic porcupine pal Anguirus come to the rescue . The opening third of this creature feature romp is pretty slow , talky and rather tedious , but fortunately things start to seriously cook when the monsters engage in an incredibly lengthy , violent and vigorous anything-goes fight ( the definite highlight occurs when Anguirus runs its spikes repeatedly into King Ghidorah's torso ! ) .

"1908 was a momentous year in the history of American films . D . W . Griffith became a director and , over the next dozen years , would transform film . Between him and his competitors , anxious to maintain their positions in an industry that threw off millions of dollars of profit every year , they would transform the standards of acting , set direction , lighting . . . everything . But it was 1908 when this movie was made and no one knew anything about those things . Well , no one in the US . We have here excerpts from the stage play , consisting of Dantes being arrested ( the Abbe appears as a corpse . Their imprisonment is summed up in the title "" 20 Years Later "" ) , the corpse being thrown","Another of the Mr . & Mrs . Sidney Drew movies , in which they take a small situational comedy and play it with great charm . In this , Mr . Drew is tired of having to give up his seat on the trolley to women with squalling brats , and so he buys a doll and passes it off as his own baby . This sequence is a lot of fun as Mr . Drew alternates between acting as if the doll is a real baby , and treating it as a mere inert prop - - and bystanders react to his cavalier behavior . Even the plot , which involves him trying to court Mrs . Drew - - they aren't married in the movie , you see - - when she believes him to be a married man with a baby - - is done in a realistic , convincing and funny way . It is a pity that a two-minute chunk of the film does is bubbled out of existence - - but so",1

"His Royal Jakeness For the past week, Jake and I have been getting some good exercise. Almost every day this week we've gone for an hour-long walk around the neighborhood. Today we did it after the huge rain storm, so we got kinda wet from walking in the puddles. It's amazing that he can urinate in so many places; I wonder how he does it. Does he have a second bladder? I've also learned that I have to carry three plastic bags when we go on this walk. When we came home, I knew that Jake needed a bath. So Keisha and I got into our swimming suits and gave him a bath outside on our driveway. He initially resisted the ordeal but gradually let what had to be done be done. Only after we'd dried him off with a towel did Jennie allow him to return inside.

"The Offence came out in 1972 as Sean Connery was desperately trying to break away from his James Bond image . It became sadly one of long list of critically acclaimed performances that flopped badly at the box office . That's a pity because he's really quite a marvel in this role as detective sergeant Johnson one of a number of investigators on the trail of a serial rapist . When the perpetrator is caught Connery interrogates him alone and so loses it he ends up beating the suspect to death . The rest of the film explains the reason for his mental breakdown . Although Connery received the critical acclaim here , my favorite in this film is Ian Bannen as the perpetrator . The best scenes in the film are Connery interrogating Bannen and","When The Joker Is Wild first came out I saw it at the Nostrand Theatre in Brooklyn , New York .
